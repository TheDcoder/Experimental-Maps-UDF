# Experimental Maps UDF
UDF for the Map datatype in AutoIt.

This UDF is made for Maps (similar to Array UDF), Map is a new datatype in AutoIt.
This UDF is still in early development and might contain bugs (either in this UDF or the Map datatype itself)

**THIS UDF IS NOT DEVELOPED OR MAINTAINED BY THE OFFICIAL AUTOIT TEAM**

I made this UDF with the intention of speeding up the process of releasing the `Map` datatype in the stable releases of AutoIt. For this reason, this UDF is licensed under The Unlicense so that AutoIt Team can adapt this UDF freely.
Unlicence gives the user of this UDF the right to copy, distribute, modify, compile etc... Please refer to `LICENSE`
